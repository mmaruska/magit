;; The magit package follows the Debian/GNU Linux 'emacsen' policy and
;; byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'emacs flavor' (emacs19,
;; xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled code is then
;; installed in a subdirectory of the respective site-lisp directory.
;; We have to add this to the load-path:
(let* ((package-name "magit")
       (flavor-dir (concat "/usr/share/" (symbol-name flavor) "/site-lisp/" package-name))
       (source-dir (concat "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/" package-name)))
;; If package-dir does not exist, the magit package must have
;; removed but not purged, and we should skip the setup.
    ;; since we add to the beginning, first the less desired/slower:
  (add-to-list 'load-path source-dir)
  (when (file-directory-p flavor-dir)
    (add-to-list 'load-path flavor-dir))
  (load "magit-init"))
