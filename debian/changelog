  * make checkout update modeline
  * Checkout should ask to save some buffers if magit-save-some-buffers is non-nil. And since this functionality is now used in three places I also created a helper function to do it.
  * like checkout, create-branch should also query if the user wants to save buffers and also update the modeline when the branch has been switched.
  * remove accidental duplicate line
  * since there is no else clause, we can turn the if statement into a when and get rid of the progn.
  * added myself as a contributor.
  * Make magit-run* look in the magit-process-buffer for a useful error string when reporting an error, and fall back on the less helpful "Git failed" message only if no error message could be found in the buffer.
